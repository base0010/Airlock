# webpack-bypass-require

Webpack automatically transforms any `require` calls. However, sometimes, you want to use Node's unadulterated.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add webpack-bypass-require
# or
npm install webpack-bypass-require
```

## Usage

```js
import webpackRequire = "webpack-bypass-require";
// or
const webpackRequire = require("webpack-bypass-require");

// then use it as Node's require to bypass Webpack:
console.log(webpackRequire.resolve("webpack"));
```
